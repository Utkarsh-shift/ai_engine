Hey Sarah, how was your weekend?

Hey Alex! It was awesome, I finally went hiking at that trail we talked about.

Nice! How was the weather?

Surprisingly good! A bit hot, but the views were totally worth it. How about you? What did you get up to?

Not much, just Netflix and chilling, you know how it goes.

Classic! Find anything good to watch?

Yeah, started a new series, actually pretty hooked now.

Sweet! We should catch up soon, maybe grab coffee or something?

Definitely! I’m free this Thursday afternoon if you’re up for it.

Sounds perfect, let’s do it. I’ll text you the details later.

Awesome, looking forward to it!
